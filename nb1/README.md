How can we account for the specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic tests when estimating disease prevalence in a population?

This notebook recreates Gelman and Carpenter 2020.

Assay:
immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 

Assay calibration by manufacturer:
18 independent test-kit assessments: 14 for specificity and 4 for sensitivity.

Bendavid et al:  pool all test-kit assessments


Gelman and Carpenter:  hierarchical model of assay sensitivity, specificity.
Sensitivity analysis of priors.
