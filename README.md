Case studies on Bayesian models for infectious disease

 - How can we account for the specificity and sensitivity of diagnostic tests when estimating disease prevalence in a population?
 - How can we use disease data from only a subset of the population to make estimates for the general population?
 - How can we model disease progression?
 - How can we compare policy interventions across different states or regions?
 - How can we smooth noisy measurements to get reasonable estimates for disease prevalence for particular location or time?
 - How can we account for non-random data missigness?

Each case study provides datasets and Stan implementations of commonly used models.
